Each course is adapted to the needs of the student (e.g. field of activity). We work with materials written in modern, up-to-date and efficient French. It is also possible to work with materials suggested by the students. Of course, I guarantee absolute confidentiality. Depending on the needs and expectations of the student, the course offers a mix of conversation, oral comprehension and expression, reading of current texts and translation."
