  "whoAmIP": "My experience comes from many years of working with students from all walks of life. My studies and career as a DE (German-French) translator/interpreter have led me to meet many people who regret having to go through an interpreter to conduct their business. This is how I became interested in teaching business French. It is an exciting profession because it helps people to improve their skills and access new professional opportunities.",
