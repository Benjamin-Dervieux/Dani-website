    "My experience comes from many years of working with students from all walks of life. My studies and career as a DE (German-French) translator/interpreter have led me to meet many people who regret having to go through an interpreter to conduct their business. This is how I became interested in teaching business French. It is an exciting profession because it helps people to improve their skills and access new professional opportunities.",

  myStudentsP:
    'My "students" are people of many different nationalities who have learned French. Their level is at least A2. The language of instruction can be German or English. Each course is adapted to the needs of the student (e.g. field of activity). We work with materials written in modern, up-to-date and efficient French. It is also possible to work with materials suggested by the students. Of course, I guarantee absolute confidentiality. Depending on the needs and expectations of the student, the course offers a mix of conversation, oral comprehension and expression, reading of current texts and translation.',
