    "My studies in Management and my long career as a certified translator-interpreter have led me to become a Business French teacher, an activity that I do online, convinced of the multiple advantages, the comfort and the efficiency of distance learning. Wishing to add legitimacy to my activity, I got the diploma formalizing the ability to teach and have been working for more than 10 years as a French teacher and a Business French teacher. My experience is the result of many years of working with international students from all walks of life.",
