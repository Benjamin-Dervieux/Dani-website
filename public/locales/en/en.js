  whoAmI: "Who am i ?",
  whoAmIP:
    "I have many years of experience with students of all levels and with different expectations. My career as a Certified Translator and Interpreter (German-French) has given me the opportunity to meet many people who have had to use the services of an interpreter to conduct their business in France or with French speaking partners and regretted not being able to talk fluently with them. This is how I changed the direction of my career and began to teach business French about 10 years ago.",

    'The "students" are people who come from different countries. They all have learned French and their level is at least A2 (Intermediate). The support language we use during the lessons - if necessary - can be either German or English. The courses are adapted to the needs of the students (e.g. field of activity). The teaching materials are modern and include business and management topics. It is also possible to work with materials suggested by the students e.g. work presentation or report. Of course, absolute confidentiality is guaranteed. Depending on the needs and expectations of the student, the training offers a mix of conversation, listening comprehension and expression, reading up to date and relevant texts about current affairs or translation.',
